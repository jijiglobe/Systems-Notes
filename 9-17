While primitives normally have one bit to denote their sign (+/-)

It is possible to declare any primitive as unsigned. This allows you to hold twice large numbers at the expense of not being able to have negative variables

   private unsigned Int x; //would declare a new unsigned int x

To compile C programs use gcc -o [outputfilename]
To run use ./[filename]
