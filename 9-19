To include certain functions in your program (similar to importing) use #include <packagename>
   most of your code will begin with
   	#include <stdio>
	#include <stdlib>
   this will include the standard in/out and standard lib in your prgram

You can also write .h files that you can include

PATH is a list of locations where you keep executables
export $PATH displays your PATH list

To run a program that is not included in PATH you can use ./[filename]
