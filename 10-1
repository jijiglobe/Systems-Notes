int strlen( char *s)
    returns the length of the string not including the terminating null

char * strcopy(char *dest, char *source)
     copies all the values from source up till the terminating null into *dest. Watch out if *dest doesn't have enough space.
     returns dest

char strcat(char *s1, char *s2)
     concatenates all the characters from s2 up to the terminating null into s1 starting by overwriting s1's terminating null

most str functions have strn versions which take an extra parameter and sets the number maximum number of bytes that will be operated on

for instance:

char strncat(char *s1, char *s2, int n)
     will concatenate bytes from s2 onto s1 as in strcat, however, it will stop if it copies n bytes without hitting a null
